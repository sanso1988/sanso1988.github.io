<p>Introduction of the book shows readers two points, one is about the book, including who is the target audience, how to read this book, etc., the other is about deep learning. We will pay more attention or efforts to the last.</p>
<p>I suppose the authors wanna answer several key questions below in deep learning background.</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#39;s the basic concepts about artificial intelligence (AI)?</li>
<li>What&#39;s the differences between approachs toward AI? What&#39;s problem each approach can solve and can&#39;t solve?</li>
<li>What&#39;s the basic idea underlies deep learning? </li>
<li>Why deep learning can solve the problem other Algorithms failed that makes it very important and special in the AI field?</li>
<li>What&#39;s the brief history that deep learning evolves?</li>
<li>What make deep learning get meteoric rise to the top of AI?</li>

</ul>
<h2 id='key-points'>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>Inventors have long dreamed of creating machines that think. The AI idea could date back to the time of Ancient Greece. Today, AI is a thriving field with many practical applications and active reasearch topics, including speech or image recognition, diagnosis in medicine and support basic scientific research.</li>
<li>In the early days of AI, the field tackled and solved the problems without intuition which is relatively straightforward for computers, but hard for human like chess, etc.</li>
<li>Deep learning is for solving more intuitive problems which human is good at but not straightforward, like recognizing spoken words, faces in images.</li>
<li>Several AI projects have sought to hard-core knowledge about the world in formal languages. It means the expert complies all the knowledges needed to solve the problem into computers. We calls it knowledge base approach to AI.</li>
<li>Knowledge base approach failed to achieve major success. The difficulties faced is the lack of ability to acquire their own knowledge by extracting patterns from the rawdata.</li>
<li>The capability of learning by computer itself is called machine learning. Simple machine learning algorithms include logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, etc. The performance of these simple machine learning algorithms depend on the representation of the data (defined features) they are given.</li>
<li>For many tasks, it&#39;s difficult to know what features should be extracted. Some machine learning methods could learn how to represent the data, the quintessential example is autoencoder algorithm. It comprises two function: encoder and decoder, is trained to preserve as much information as possible and to make the new features have nice properties. We call this type of algorithms representation learning. But it can be very difficult to extract high-level, abstract features which really matter from raw data. Representation learning has significant drawback.</li>
<li>Deep learning solves this central problem in representation learning by introducing representation that are expressed in terms of other, simpler representations. It refines the information by layers. Figure 1.2 illustrates the basic idea of deep learning in the book.</li>
<li>Deep learning dates back to the 1940s. Broadly speaking, there have been three waves of development: cybenetics in the 1940s-1960s, connectionism in the 1980s-1990s, and current name from 2006. Deep learning believed to be inspired by neuroscience, but gone far beyond.</li>
<li>Deep learning dates back long time ago, but become recognized the crucial technology recently. Increasing dataset size and model sizes led to increasing prediction accuracy is the key. The most important new development is that today we can provide deep learning algorithms with the resources they need to succeed. The resources mean enough data and high computer calculation and memory capability.</li>
<li>One of crowning achievement of deep learning is its extension to the domain of <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>. DeepMind demonstrated that a deep reinforcement learning system is capable of learning to play Atari video games, reaching human-level performance in many games.</li>

</ul>
<h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In summary, deep learning is an approach to AI and is a particular kind of machine learning. It achieves great power and flexibility by representing the real world as a nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones. Deep learning has drawn heavily on our knowledge of brain, statistics and applied math as it developed over the past several decades. Recently, deep learning makes many great progress and verified to be a powerful tool, roughly as the result of stronger computers and larger dataset to train deeper networks.</p>
